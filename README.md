# NLP-Projects
This repository consists of different independent projects/files implementing NLP or other ML algorithms based applications 

**1. UtteranceCompare.py**
This file takes an input of a Google Dialogflow training data dump in JSON format and compares the sentence similarity/ exactly same statements or words present within different intents. It outputs a JSON file enlisting conflicting intents. 

The objective is to improve the training data quality, since sentence similarity in different intents causes the model to confuse intents and reduce NLU accuracy.
